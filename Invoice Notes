8-12-2020:
Started the skeleton of the project. Created the 5 pages and further reviewed the Adobe XD files sent to me by Maddison.
Meeting was with Maddison on 8-11-2020 @ 10 a.m. via Zoom. She and I discussed the project. We agreed to hold weekly Zoom calls to discuss progression.
I am going to be importing images when she sends those to me and updating the logo soon. I will be in contact with Maddison about the logo later today.

Thus far, I have imported font awesome to use icons for facebook and linkedin. I will be able to create the contact page and form quickly. 
I am estimating this project to take 4 weeks at the most. 3 weeks to build and 1 week to test for and correct bugs.
I'll be adding in filler content for the evening and I'll be able to change those later when I have photos for the main content.

Created the dropdown button and styled it. Gave it a nice hover effect. Added discover button and working on the feature for that.
I've implemented the header bar to scroll along with the user. I'll be adding a shadow effect to that at a later time.
